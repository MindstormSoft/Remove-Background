# Background Removal from Image using Python

## Problem Statement
Develop a Python program that removes the background from an image and produces a clear foreground image with no additional pixels.

## Objective
Create a program that accurately removes the background from provided images, ensuring the resulting image has a clear foreground with no additional noise.

## Requirements

### 1. Language Requirement
- The solution must be implemented using the Python programming language.

### 2. Functionality
- The program should accurately remove the background from the provided images.
- The resulting image should have a clear foreground with no additional pixels or noise.

### 3. Input and Output
- The program should accept an image file as input (common formats such as JPEG, PNG).
- The output should be the foreground image with the background removed, saved in the same format as the input.

### 4. Libraries and Tools
- Participants are allowed to use any Python libraries and tools, such as OpenCV, PIL, or other relevant libraries, as long as they are free to use and properly documented in the submission.

### 5. Use of AI
- You can use any kind of AI tools or services.
- Do not use API keys for problem-solving.

### 6. Submission
- Participants must submit their code, along with a brief README file explaining how to run the program and any dependencies required.
- A sample set of images will be provided for testing, and the output images should be included in the submission.

### 7. Evaluation Criteria
- Accuracy of background removal.
- Clarity of the resulting image (no additional pixels or artifacts).
- Code quality and documentation.
- Efficiency and performance of the solution.
- The program should run without internet access.

## Sample Images
A sample set of images for testing is provided in the `samples` directory. Use these images to test the program and verify the results.
